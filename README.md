## Usage of script run_analysis.R
The script run_analysis.R reads related input files and produces a tidy data set. Follow the following instructions.

1. Download the data set at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip it into your working directory in the R environment.
2. Run source("run_analysis.R"), assuming that package dplyr is installed and the R script run_analysis.R is in the working directory. Find the output file data_step5.txt for the new tidy data set  in the working directory.
